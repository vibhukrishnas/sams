# SAMS Git Branching Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive branching strategy for the SAMS (Server and Application Monitoring System) project.

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### Main Branches

#### `main`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Highly protected, requires PR reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to production
- **Merge Policy**: Only from `develop` or `hotfix/*` branches

#### `develop`
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Protection**: Requires PR review
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to staging
- **Merge Policy**: Features merge here first

#### `staging`
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Protection**: Moderate protection
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment for testing
- **Merge Policy**: From `develop` for release candidates

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### Feature Development
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Development**
   - Make commits with descriptive messages
   - Follow conventional commit format
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

3. **Pull Request**
   - Create PR to `develop` branch

   - Request code review
   - Ensure CI/CD passes

4. **Code Review**
   - At least 1 reviewer for feature branches
   - At least 2 reviewers for critical features
   - Address feedback and update code

5. **Merge**
   - Squash and merge to `develop`
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### Release Process
1. **Create Release Branch**

## üîí Branch Protection Rules

### `main` Branch
- Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- Require signed commits

### `develop` Branch
- Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging

### Feature Branches
- No direct protection (managed through PR process)
- Automatic deletion after merge

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Strategy

### Version Tags
- `v1.0.0` - Major release
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release
- `v1.1.1` - Patch release
- `v1.2.0-beta.1` - Pre-release

### Component Tags
- `backend-v1.0.0` - Backend-specific release
- `mobile-v1.0.0` - Mobile app-specific release
- `agents-v1.0.0` - Monitoring agents release

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### Automated Triggers
- **Feature branches**: Run tests and build
- **develop**: Deploy to staging environment
- **main**: Deploy to production environment
- **release/***: Create release candidate builds
- **hotfix/***: Emergency deployment pipeline

### Status Checks
- Unit tests (backend and mobile)
- Integration tests
- Security scans
- Code quality checks
- Build verification
- Documentation updates

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Branch Metrics
- Feature branch lifetime
- PR review time
- Merge frequency
- Hotfix frequency
- Release cycle time

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage per branch
- Code quality scores
- Security vulnerability count
- Performance benchmarks

## üîß Tools and Automation

### Git Hooks
- Pre-commit: Code formatting, linting
- Pre-push: Run tests
- Post-merge: Update dependencies

### Automation Scripts
- Branch creation automation
- PR template population
- Release note generation
- Changelog updates

## üìö Best Practices

### Commit Messages
```
feat(backend): add real-time alert processing
fix(mobile): resolve login validation issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
test(agents): add unit tests for metrics collection
```

### PR Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Reference related issues

### Code Review
- Review for functionality, security, and performance
- Check test coverage
- Verify documentation updates
- Ensure consistent coding standards

This branching strategy ensures organized development, quality control, and smooth deployment processes for the SAMS monitoring system.
