## 🚀 **HOW TO SET UP YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY**

### **Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**

1. **Update Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Edit setup-github-repo.sh
   GITHUB_USERNAME="your-actual-username"
   REPO_NAME="sams-monitoring-system"
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   chmod +x setup-github-repo.sh
   ./setup-github-repo.sh
   
   # On Windows (Git Bash)
   bash setup-github-repo.sh
   ```

### **Option 2: Manual Setup**

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `sams-monitoring-system`
   - Description: "SAMS - Enterprise Server and Application Monitoring System"
   - Make it **Public**
   - **Don't** initialize with README

2. **Initialize Local Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git checkout -b main
   git add .
   git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit: Complete SAMS Monitoring System"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sams-monitoring-system.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Create All Branches:**
   ```bash
   # Run the git setup script
   bash git-setup.sh
   
   # Or manually create key branches
   git checkout -b develop main
   git push -u origin develop
   
   git checkout -b staging main
   git push -u origin staging
   ```

4. **Push All Branches:**
   ```bash
   git push --all origin
   ```

### **Option 3: GitHub CLI (Fastest)**

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
# Windows: winget install GitHub.cli
# Mac: brew install gh
# Linux: apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create sams-monitoring-system --public --description "SAMS - Enterprise Monitoring System"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sams-monitoring-system.git
git push -u origin main

# Run automated setup
bash setup-github-repo.sh
```

## 🔒 **BRANCH PROTECTION SETUP**

After pushing to GitHub, set up branch protection:

1. **Go to Repository Settings → Branches**
