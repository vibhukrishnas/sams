# npm resolution error report

While resolving: TestApp@0.0.1
Found: @types/react@18.3.23
node_modules/@types/react
  dev @types/react@"^18.2.6" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @types/react@"^19.0.0" from react-native-windows@0.79.1
node_modules/react-native-windows
  peer react-native-windows@">=0.62" from react-native-print@0.11.0
  node_modules/react-native-print
    react-native-print@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
