# npm resolution error report

While resolving: sams-mobile-testapp@2.1.0
Found: react-native@0.72.17
node_modules/react-native
  react-native@"^0.72.7" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react-native@">=0.74.0" from react-native-super-grid@6.0.1
node_modules/react-native-super-grid
  react-native-super-grid@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
