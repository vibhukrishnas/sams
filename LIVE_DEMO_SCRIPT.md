Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/health"
```

## ðŸ“‹ DEMO EXECUTION (45 minutes)

### **1. OPENING - System Overview (5 minutes)**

**Script:** *"Good afternoon! Today I'm excited to show you SAMS - our comprehensive monitoring solution that directly addresses your three key requirements: application log capture, remote command execution, and Windows/Linux support. What you'll see today is not a prototype, but a fully operational system running live on our infrastructure."*

**Live Command:**
```powershell
# Show system is operational
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/info"
```

**Expected Output:** Service info, version, available endpoints
**Talking Point:** *"As you can see, we have a production-ready Java Spring Boot backend with multiple monitoring endpoints already operational."*

### **2. APPLICATION LOG CAPTURE DEMO (15 minutes)**

#### **Real-Time System Monitoring**

**Script:** *"Let's start with live application monitoring. I'll show you real-time data capture from our Windows server - this is live data, not simulated."*

```powershell
# Complete system information
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/system"
```

**Expected Output:** Hostname, OS, CPU info, memory usage, disk space, running processes
**Talking Point:** *"Notice we're capturing comprehensive system data: Windows 11, 12-core i7 processor, 16GB memory with real usage percentages, and live process monitoring."*

#### **Specific Metric Monitoring**

**Script:** *"Now let me show you focused monitoring capabilities:"*

```powershell
# CPU monitoring
Write-Host "=== CPU MONITORING ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/system/cpu"

### **3. REMOTE COMMAND EXECUTION DEMO (15 minutes)**

#### **API-Based Command Framework**

**Script:** *"Now for remote command execution. Our REST API framework provides secure, authenticated command capabilities. Let me demonstrate:"*

```powershell
# System health command
Write-Host "=== SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK ===" -ForegroundColor Green
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/health"

# System information command
Write-Host "`n=== SYSTEM INFORMATION COMMAND ===" -ForegroundColor Green  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/system" | Select-Object hostname, os, architecture, processors

# Process monitoring command
Write-Host "`n=== PROCESS MONITORING COMMAND ===" -ForegroundColor Green
$system = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/system"
$system.processes | Select-Object -First 5 | Format-Table pid, name, status, cpu_percent, memory_percent
```

**Expected Output:** Health status, system info, top processes
**Talking Point:** *"These are real command executions through our secure API. We can retrieve system information, check health status, and monitor processes - all through authenticated REST endpoints."*

#### **Alert Management Commands**

```powershell
# Check current alerts
Write-Host "`n=== ALERT MANAGEMENT ===" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/alerts"

# Show alert capabilities
Write-Host "Alert management endpoints available:"
Write-Host "- GET  /api/alerts (view alerts)"
Write-Host "- POST /api/alerts/{id}/acknowledge (acknowledge alerts)"  
Write-Host "- DELETE /api/alerts (clear alerts)"
```

**Expected Output:** Current alerts (likely empty), endpoint list
**Talking Point:** *"Our command framework includes alert management - you can view, acknowledge, and manage alerts through secure API commands."*

### **4. MOBILE APP INTEGRATION DEMO (10 minutes)**

#### **Launch Mobile Application**

**Script:** *"Now let me show you something really exciting - our mobile application that connects directly to the same Java backend we've been using. This demonstrates true cross-platform accessibility."*

```powershell
# Start mobile app (in separate terminal)
cd d:\Projects\SAMS\SAMSMobileExpo
.\run-mobile-demo.bat
```

**Expected Output:** Expo development server starts, QR code appears, web version launches
**Talking Point:** *"The mobile app connects directly to our Java backend on port 5002. Same APIs, same real-time data, but optimized for mobile devices."*

#### **Mobile App Features Demonstration**

**Script:** *"Watch as the mobile app loads the exact same live data we've been viewing through our API calls:"*

**Mobile App Shows:**
- **Connection Status:** Green indicator showing "Connected" to backend
- **System Information:** Same hostname, OS, architecture data
- **Real-time Metrics:** Live CPU, memory, disk usage with color-coded warnings
- **Network Statistics:** Bytes sent/received, packet counts
- **Alert Management:** Current alerts display
- **Auto-refresh:** 30-second automatic updates

**Talking Point:** *"Notice the mobile app displays the same real-time data - 85% memory usage, 80% disk usage, Windows 11 system information. This is live data from our monitoring system, accessible anywhere on any device."*

#### **Cross-Platform Mobile Access**

**Script:** *"This mobile application works across all platforms:"*

**Demonstrate:**
- **Web Browser:** Show app running in browser
- **QR Code:** Show how mobile devices can scan and connect
- **Responsive Design:** Show app adapts to different screen sizes

**Talking Point:** *"Your team can monitor infrastructure from their phones, tablets, or any web browser. Same backend, same data, universal access."*
